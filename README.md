## Hey, I'm Dhruv 👋

Professionally a software engineer. Realistically? A computer geek trying to understand how systems think — not just *how* they work, but *why* they work the way they do.  <br/>
I don’t do fluff. I don’t do bullshit.  <br/>
If I shipped something half-baked, it’s not because I didn’t care — it’s because I cared too damn much, tried too damn long, and eventually got so frustrated I said: *fuck it*.

### 🚀 Currently Building: [Heimdall](https://github.com/alias404/heimdall)

A secure, scalable, AI-powered analytics system — the kind of tool that respects both the user *and* the codebase. <br/>
Not a duct-taped, analytics-afterthought. <br/>
I'm building it the way software **should** be built — carefully, intentionally, respectfully.
No shortcuts. No corporate clownery. <br/>
Feel free to contribute if that resonates with you.

### 🔍 Lately Into: Psychology of Systems

What makes them tick. Why they behave the way they do. <br/>
Computers, humans, decision trees — all of it. <br/>
Trying to understand the reasoning, not just the results.

### ✨ Blogs

> Most of it starts with frustration and ends with, </br>
> “Okay fine, I’ll write it myself.”

Some things I’ve written — raw, honest, sometimes helpful:

- [How DNS Works: A Guide to Understanding the Internet's Address Book](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-dns-works-the-internets-address-book/)
- [The Shared Code Dilemma: Merging Features vs. Staying Isolated](https://alias404.github.io/Git/#/shared-code-dilemma/)

### ⚡ Git Obsession

Git is pure magic. No exaggeration. <br/>
I've been maintaining a [Git Handbook](https://alias404.github.io/Git/#/) — not some beginner cheat sheet, but something deeper.
A living doc of the weird little commands and workflows I love. <br/>
If you’ve got ideas or questions, I’m all ears.

### 🐰 Recent Rabbit Hole: Golang

Its hype is impossible to ignore — and turns out, it’s earned. <br/>
Fast. Clean. No-nonsense. <br/>
So I’m hanging around, building things, and seeing how far I can push it. <br/>
No language wars. No gatekeeping. <br/>

### 🎵 Music & Sound

Been learning guitar for a while — not consistently, but haven’t lost what I’ve learned. <br/>
Also recently discovered this brilliant generative music project: [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/). <br/>
It’s absolutely nuts (in the best way). Planning to dive in.

### 💪 No Language Flexing. No Framework Name-Dropping.

I'm a software engineer. <br/>
There’s no excuse for not learning what needs to be learned. <br/>
The tool is never the excuse. The mindset is.

Here to build, learn, and maybe leave things better than I found them.
